Shana Sheem, CS 300 Fall 2025, assignment 2 (mini dbe)


Approach to designing the engine class:

- made diagrams of how the heap and the two BSTs work together, during the operations (insertion, deletion, the others)

- wrote drafts for the methods and continually tested them

- reviewed the early drafts and looked for redundancies to eliminate


Challenges:

- C++ lambda syntax is new

- C++ pointer syntax still relatively new


Insights gained:

- Introduction to C++ lambdas

- Better understanding of C++ syntax, especially pointers

- Better understanding of BST components

- Better understanding of BST structure
